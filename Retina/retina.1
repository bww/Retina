.Sh SYNOPSIS

.Op Ar

Create standard resolution counterparts for retina resolution images (image@2x.png ==> image.png)
.Pp
.Nm
.Fl R
.Op Fl fpvh
.Op Ar file
.Op Ar
.br
Create retina resolution counterparts for standard resolution images (image.png ==> image@2x.png)
.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
For each operand that names a
.Ar file
of type directory,
.Nm
examines each PNG file contained within that directory to determine if a scaled-down or scaled-up
counterpart image should be created. For each operand that names a
.Ar file
which is not a directory, the named file is examined and is assumed to be a PNG image.
.Pp
Images encountered with a filename that contains the suffix
.Ar @2x
immediately before the file extension are considered to be retina resolution images. When the
.Fl S
flag is used, these images will be scaled down to create standard resolution counterparts.
Images with a filename that does not contain this suffix are considered to be standard
resolution images. When the
.Fl R
flag is used, these images will be scaled up to create retina resolution counterparts.
.Pp
As you would assume, using
.Fl R
to scale up standard resolution images will produce retina resolution images which are pixellated.
This option may seem to have dubious utility, but it is included nonetheless for completeness, and
because such images can be helpful to designers creating a retina resolution set of images from
standard resolution images.
.Pp
Normally,
.Nm
only creates counterparts to images when either no counterpart is present, or when a counterpart
is present but the counterpart file is older than the source file. You can force
.Nm
to create counterparts to all images encountered by using the
.Fl f
flag.

One or both of the following are required in order to do anything useful:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl S -standard
Create scaled-down standard resolution counterparts for retina resoulution images encountered.
.It Fl R -retina
Create scaled-up retina resolution counterparts for standard resoulution images encountered.

The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl p -plan
Show what would happen if
.Nm
were run without this option, but don't actually create any counterpart images.
.It Fl f -force
Force
.Nm
to create counterparts for every suitable image encountered regardless of whether they are already up-to-date.
.It Fl v -verbose
Be more verbose. Additional information about the conversion process is displayed.
.It Fl h -help
Display brief help information and exit.
